Why did you split it into these specific functions? I split it so each part of the game has its own "job". One handles input, one handles logic, and one handles the overall flow. This makes the code easier to read.

What's one function that took multiple tries to get right? The determine_winner function was tricky because I had to make sure all the win/loss conditions for Rock Paper Scissors were covered correctly in the if/elif block.

How did using functions make your code better than having it all in one block? It’s much cleaner. If I want to change how the computer chooses (e.g., make it more difficult), I only need to change one function without touching the rest of the game logic.
