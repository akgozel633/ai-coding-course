What does your program decide? My program helps the user choose the most effective study method based on the subject type, how much time they have, and their current energy level.

What's one interesting if/elif/else you used? I used a combination of conditions in the elif statement: energy_level == "low" or time_available < 30. This allows the program to recommend a short "Pomodoro" session if the user is either tired or just busy, which covers two different scenarios with one result.

What AI prompt helped you most? "I need to build a Python decision maker with 3 questions and if/elif/else logic for a school project. Can you help me structure it for a Study Method Selector?"
