 1. When is a for loop better than a while loop?
 A for loop is better when you know the exact number of steps (like counting 1-10).
 A while loop is better when you don't know how long it will take (like waiting for a correct password).

 2. What's one bug you ran into and how did you fix it?
 I got a ValueError because I entered a string instead of a number. 
 I fixed it by making sure I only type integers when the program asks for input.
